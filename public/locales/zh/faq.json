  "general": {
    "我最多可以注册多长的名字?": "名字不能少于 3 个字符。可被包装的名字，它的标签最多只能有 256 字节。",
    "名字中可以包含 emoji 吗?": "可以!",
    "如果名字过期了会怎么样?": "名字过期后，有 90 天的宽限期，在此期间，名字的所有者不能编辑记录，但仍然可以重新注册这个名字。在这段宽限期之后，名字会被释放，任何人都可以注册，但此时名字会有一个临时溢价，该溢价在 21 天内递减。<br/><br/>过期名字的记录不会丢失，所以仍然会解析到之前的 ETH 地址，直到新的所有者重新设置它。",
    "我在哪里可以看到即将过期释放的名字列表?": "您可以在 [Dune Analytics 数据表盘](https://dune.xyz/makoto/ens-released-to-be-released-names) 上找到一个名为 _ENS Names to be released_ 汇总表。",
    "ENS 个人资料是什么?": "ENS 个人资料是预定义记录的集合，供其他 dApp 使用。在 ENS 中创建您的个人资料，能让您在 Web3 拥有一套单一来源的个人资料信息。",
    "ENS 头像是什么?": "您可以使用上传的图像，或使用 NFT 作为您的 ENS 头像。这能让 dApp 引入并作为你的 web3 头像，同时也会更新你的 ENS NFT 背景。<br/><br/>要添加头像，请从您任意名字的个人资料选项卡上单击 “编辑个人资料”。NFT头像必须是 ERC721/ERC1155 NFT，并具备有效的图像 URI。",
    "我可以使用 ENS 名字来指向我的网站吗?": "虽然 ENS 在技术上可以存储任何东西，但是能将 ENS 解析到 IP 地址的第三方工具和应用程序并不多。<br/><br/>相反，我们建议将静态 html、css 以及图像托管在 IPFS 上，并将其哈希值放在 ENS 名字的内容记录中。然后可以通过支持 ENS 的浏览器 (例如 Opera)、浏览器扩展 (Metamask) 来解析，或在任意浏览器中通过附加 \".link\" 或 \".limo\" 后缀来解析 (例如 vitalik.eth.link 或 vitalik.eth.limo)。<br/><br/>如果您想将您的 ENS 名字重定向到一个现有的网站，您可以编写一个包含 JavaScript 重定向代码的 html 文件，并使用 [IPFS Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) 等服务将该文件上传到 ipfs，然后将 CID 设置为 ENS 的内容哈希。可参考 depositcontract.eth.limo 的源代码。",
    "我在 NFT 市场上买了名字，我该如何使用它?": "当您购买一个现有的名字时，它可能还保留着上一个所有者的记录。要使用它作为您的主名，请确保将您的 ETH 地址更新到它的 ETH 记录中，然后再从设置页面更新您的主名。<br/><br/>您还可以选择删除或覆盖当前记录，或者创建自己的个人资料。"

  "register": {
    "Can I register names other than .eth?": "Yes! You can import any DNS name that has DNSSEC-enabled into ENS. Please refer to our [guide](https://docs.ens.domains/dns-registrar-guide) for more detail.",
    "How much does it cost to register a .eth name?": "Currently, registration costs are set at the following prices:<br/><ul><br/>  <li>5+ character .eth names: $5 in ETH per year.</li>  <li>4 character .eth names: $160 in ETH per year.</li>  <li>3 character .eth names $640 in ETH per year.</li></ul><br/>3 and 4 character names have 'premium' pricing to reflect the small number of these names available. Recently released names will also have a temporary premium.",
    "What is a temporary premium?": "If a name is recently released it will have a temporary premium to prevent squatters snatching names. To give fair opportunity, the premium starts at $100,000,000 and reduces to $0 over 21 days.",
    "I'm stuck during registration, what should I do?": "<ul><li>At step 1: If you sped up your transaction you will need to refresh the page, as the app cannot detect this.</li><li>At step 2: The countdown timer may take up to an additional minute to allow the blockchain to progress. If this continues for more than 5 minutes, please send us a [direct message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ensdomains).<ul><li>Note that if you leave step 2 for more than 7 days your registration will reset and you will need to start again from step 1.</li></ul></li><li>At step 3: This step may fail when the USD price for a name changes and you haven't registered with enough ETH. Please try the transaction again.<ul><li>Note that if you leave step 3 for more than 24 hours your registration will reset and you will need to start again from step 1.</li></ul></li></ul>",
    "Is it safe to refresh or leave the page during registration?": "Yes, it is safe to refresh the page or close the browser once step 1 transaction is complete. However you cannot switch to different devices or machines because it needs a locally stored “secret” which will be used at step 3. Please also do not delete browser history during the registration.",
    "I cannot see my names in my wallet or NFT marketplaces": "Many wallets and sites fetch metadata from OpenSea and there may be delays when OpenSea is under heavy load.<br/><br/>As long as you can see your registered name under _Names_ when connected to the ENS app, or your ETH address in the name's records, your name is registered successfully.",
    "My new name already has records. Is this a bug?": "When names are transferred, resold, or released, they do not lose their existing records. It is safe to update or remove these records."
  },
  "manage": {
    "What records can I add? Is ENS only for storing an Ethereum address?": "You can store the addresses of over 100 blockchains, a content hash of a decentralized website, profile information such as an avatar and Twitter handle, and more. ENS even allows you to create custom records that can be used by other applications.",
    "What is a primary ENS name?": "A Primary ENS Name (previously Reverse Record) points your Ethereum address to an ENS name. This allows dApps to find and display your ENS name when you connect to them with your Ethereum account. You can only have one primary name per address.<br/><br/>Sending money to an ENS name will resolve to the eth address record, and is not dependent on having a primary name set. However, your primary name must match your Ethereum address record.<br/><br/>To set or change your primary name, visit the settings page in the ENS app.",
    "How do I set up my profile?": "ENS profiles are a collection of pre-defined records, which are used by other dApps. When connected to the ENS app and viewing a name you own, you will see an _Edit Profile_ button on the _Profile_ tab. Here you can update the specific records used for profiles.",
    "What are Managers and Owners?": "The Owner is the ultimate owner of the name. For .eth names the Owner (formerly Registrant) of a name can change the Manager and transfer ownership. Not all names will have an owner. If you have PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL burned as a subname, you will be considered the owner as the parent cannot take over your name.<br/><br/>The Manager (formerly Controller) of a name can change the resolver and add/edit records. Some dApps (eg: Fleek, OpenSea) set themselves as Manager so they can update records on your behalf. If your .eth name is wrapped, you will not have a Manager as these ownerships are now combined under just a single owner.",
    "How do I send my name to another address?": "Sending your name to another address will let you transfer the Owner, Manager or both to a new Ethereum address. This can be done from the _More_ tab when viewing a name you own.<br/><br/>Sending the name to another address will not update the records, or make it the primary name for the new address.",
    "What is a Resolver?": "A Resolver is a smart contract that holds records. By default, names are set to the Public Resolver, which is developed and maintained by the ENS team and has all the standard ENS record types. This is recommended for most users, but you can use custom contracts if you'd like.<br/><br/>If you are using an older version of the resolver, you can upgrade it from within the ENS app in the More tab.",
    "What is the Name Wrapper?": "Wrapping a name is an upgrade that gives older names access to more modern features, such as burnable permissions and ERC1155 NFT support. All newly registered names are wrapped by default.<br/><br/>If you do have an unwrapped name you will see a prompt to upgrade in the ENS app. This is of course optional, and your name will still work without it.<br/><br/>You can view a full list of feature [on Github](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper).",
    "How do I find the labelhash/namehash of a name?": "Please refer to our [developer documentation page.](https://docs.ens.domains/contract-api-reference/name-processing#how-do-i-find-the-labelhash-namehash-of-a-name)",
    "What is the difference between a name and a subname?": "Both are names, however subnames have a parent name. For example with resolver.ens.eth, ens.eth is the name while resolver is the subname.<br/><br/>Subnames usually inherit the permissions of the parent name, however parent name owners can burn their permissions, giving subnames more control.",
    "What are permissions?": "Permissions allow the owner of a parent name to remove their access to certain features on subnames. For example, by default only the parent name owner can transfer ownership of a subname. With permissions, the parent name owner can remove their ability to do so, allowing trustless subnames. Before burning any permissions, the name must first burn the ability to unwrap and the wrapper expiry must not be expired."

  "troubleshoot": {
    "How can I receive an extension reminder?": "",
    "Why are some of my names shown as a jumble of characters?": "Names are stored as a hash on-chain that are then decoded using a list of possible names. If it cannot be matched to a name you will instead see the hash.<br/><br/>You can still access and manage the name if you search for the name directly in the search bar.",
    "I lost access to the Ethereum account that owns a name I registered. Can I still extend its registration period?": "Any Ethereum account can pay to extend the registration of any ENS name, though doing so will not change ownership of the name.",
    "How do I unregister my name?": "Names cannot be unregistered until they expire and their grace period runs out. However, there are some steps that can be taken to remove functionality or ownership.<br/><br/>- Removing your address records means that people can no longer look up your address with the name.<br/>- You can remove a primary name from settings.<br/>- You can transfer ownership to a burn address (eg: 0x0000…dead).<br/><br/>Keep in mind that nothing can erase the fact that you owned a name in the past as it is all on chain. Names will also become available for registration again, once they expire.",
    "I registered names before 2019 May. Can I have my deposit back?": "Yes, you can get your deposit back from[ reclaim.ens.domains](https://reclaim.ens.domains/) whether you extended the registration of the name or not.<br/><br/>Please remember that the amount you will receive is the amount of the second-highest bidder (unless you were the only bidder). For example, if you bid 1 ETH and the second highest bidder bid 0.1 ETH, you deposited 0.1 ETH and you have already received the remaining (0.9 ETH) when you finailsed the auction. Therefore you can now only reclaim 0.1 ETH back. Please read the[ the initial guide back in 2017](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-an-ens-domain-3ccac2bdc770) for more detail.",
    "How can I get more support?": "To get in touch with us send a [direct message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ensdomains). This is the best place for any support questions.<br/><br/>You can also join our community through [Discord](https://chat.ens.domains/) or the [DAO Governance forums](https://discuss.ens.domains/).
